          CBOR: Generating Numeric Map Labels from Textual EDN
                  draft-bormann-cbor-edn-mapkey-latest

Abstract

   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, STD 94 == RFC 8949)
   is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of
   extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and
   extensibility without the need for version negotiation.

   CBOR diagnostic notation (EDN) is widely used to represent CBOR data
   items in a way that is accessible to humans, for instance for
   examples in a specification.  Complex examples often use nested maps,
   the map keys (labels) for each of which are often sourced from
   different specifications.  While the e'' application extension
   provides a way to import data items, particularly constant values,
   from a CDDL model, it does not help with automatically selecting the
   right kind of map depending on its position in the nested maps.


   // The present document is intended to capture ideas initially
   // discussed at the CBOR WG interim 2025-06-25 and demonstrate some
   // design alternatives.  It is not ready for adoption yet in any way.

2.  The mapkey<<>> application extension: importing map labels from CDDL

Problem

   In diagnostic notation examples, authors often would prefer to use
   text names in place of the integer map keys that are used in a
   protocol message for efficiency.  While the e'' application extension
   provides a way to associate names with integer data items, the
   protocol designer must be very careful to use the right name for the
   kind of map that uses the integer key: Different specifications may
   use different integer numbers for a key with the same textual name,
   and even in a single specification there may be homonyms that resolve
   to different integer values in different kinds of maps (e.g., in
   [STD96], alg is represented by 1 in headers and by 3 in COSE_Key).

   For example, Figure 4 in Section 3.5.2 of [RFC9528] contains this
   example that employs nested maps:

   {                                              /CCS/
     2 : "42-50-31-FF-EF-37-32-39",               /sub/
     8 : {                                        /cnf/
       1 : {                                      /COSE_Key/
         1 : 1,                                   /kty/
         2 : h'00',                               /kid/
        -1 : 4,                                   /crv/
        -2 : h'b1a3e89460e88d3a8d54211dc95f0b90   /x/
               3ff205eb71912d6db8f4af980d2db83a'
       }
     }
   }

   To check this example, a human reviewer has to look up the integer
   labels in the specifications for the different maps employed and
   translate them to the names of the map keys defined for each type of
   map.  The outer map is a CWT Claims Set (CCS), for which the labels 2
   (sub) and 8 (cnf) are defined in [RFC8392] and [RFC8747],
   respectively.  Within cnf, the label for COSE_Key is also defined by
   [RFC8747], while the labels within that map are defined in Section 7
   of RFC 9052 [STD96].  Map keys are also often an extension point, and
   obtaining their numeric values therefore also may require consulting
   an IANA registry.

   The objective of the present proposal is that a specification writer
   could employ an EDN app-extension that allows the example to read a
   bit like:

   mapkey<<"Claims-Set",
     {
       "sub": "42-50-31-FF-EF-37-32-39"
       "cnf": {
         "COSE_Key": {
           "kty": "OKP"
           "kid": h'00'
           "crv": "X25519"
           "x": h'b1a3e89460e88d3a8d54211dc95f0b90
                 3ff205eb71912d6db8f4af980d2db83a'
         }
       }
     }
   >>

   Note that this example not only uses names for map keys, but also
   uses names for map values 1 ("OKP") and 4 ("X25519").


   // Discussion: For use in EDN, the names need to be provided in some
   form that is a valid CBOR data item.  In the example above, this is
   done in text strings; for increased clarity, it could be done in a
   more eye-catching way, e.g., as single-quoted (byte) strings or even
   in an e'...'-like construct.

Solution

   In many cases, the constants needed to handle the numeric map labels
   in this example are already available in a CDDL model, or could be
   easily made available in this way.

   For the example used in this section, [RFC9781] provides CDDL for
   [RFC8392] and [RFC8747], and [STD96] provides CDDL for its own data
   types.  Note that, to remain useful with extension points where new
   map keys are defined regularly, there needs to be a way to reference
   IANA registries for the name-to-integer translation; this is a
   separate problem for which a potential solution is presented in
   Appendix A.2.1 of [I-D.bormann-cbor-cddl-2-draft].

   This section needs to define where in the CDDL the names to be
   resolved are looked for; CDDL rule names are one obvious candidate,
   as are member names for group choices that are often employed for
   documentation (Figure 2 in Section 2 of [RFC9290] shows member names
   such as "title", "detail", etc.):

      problem-details = non-empty<{
        ? &(title: -1) => oltext
        ? &(detail: -2) => oltext
        ? &(instance: -3) => ~uri
        ? &(response-code: -4) => uint .size 1
        ? &(base-uri: -5) => ~uri
        ? &(base-lang: -6) => tag38-ltag
        ? &(base-rtl: -7) => tag38-direction

   This specification defines an app-extension mapkey<<>> with two
   parameters:

   *  The name of the CDDL rule for the top level (here: Claims-Set),
      and

   *  an EDN depiction of the data structure where names can be used in
      place of numeric map keys and values.

   Note that the app-extension does not itself define where the CDDL
   definitions it uses come from.  This information needs to come from
   the context of the example, and there is probably value in
   establishing a convention.

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to make the following two assignments in the CBOR
   Diagnostic Notation Application-extension Identifiers registry
   [IANA.cbor-diagnostic-notation] established by
   [I-D.ietf-cbor-edn-literals]:

         +==================================+====================+
         | Application-extension Identifier | Description        |
         +==================================+====================+
         | mapkey                           | import map labels  |
         |                                  | from external CDDL |
         +----------------------------------+--------------------+

                Table 1: Additions to Application-extension
                            Identifier Registry

   All entries have the Change Controller "IETF" and the Reference "RFC-
   XXXX".


   // RFC Editor: please replace RFC-XXXX with the RFC number of this
   // RFC, [IANA.cbor-diagnostic-notation] with a reference to the
   // registry group established by [I-D.ietf-cbor-edn-literals], and
   // remove this note.

4.  Security considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC8610], [STD94],
   [I-D.ietf-cbor-edn-literals] apply.

   TBD.
